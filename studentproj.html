    <h2 style="text-align: center"> Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        For this project I used a dataset from Kaggle about student habits such as 
        amount of sleep, study hours per day, and exercise per day and compared them
        to their academic performance. The question was to see if there is a 
        relationship between the amount of study hours and exam scores.

    <h2 style="text-align: center">Text Analysis Example</h2>
    <p>
        After cleaning the data, finding the average scores and study hours, I made code to see if 
        students who studied for more than 5 hours a day have higher scores on average compared to 
        students who had studied less than 5 hours.

        <i>The code is looking at the column 'study hours per day' and checking it's value 
           to see if it's greater than 5. Then it looks at the 'exam scores' column and finds the 
           mean of those students. This shows that those who studied for more than 5 hours per day 
            had scored better on their exam on average, compared to those who studied 
            less than 5 hours. </i>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Final Result</h2>
    <p>
        By using vectorization I was able to quickly analyze the data in the dataframe. 
        Instead of looping individually through each student, I was able to look at the entire 
        column at the same time. This allows me to easily see if certain habits had an impact
        on their academic performance.
